# Kiira for VS Code

**Live type-checking for TypeScript & JavaScript code fences inside Markdown.**

Kiira extracts the ` ```ts ` / ` ```tsx ` / ` ```js ` / ` ```jsx ` code blocks from
your Markdown and type-checks them against your **real project** — the same
`tsconfig`, the same workspace packages, the same dependency types. Broken example
code in your docs gets a red squiggle the moment you write it, mapped back to the
exact line inside the fence.

> Powered by [`kiira`](https://github.com/AlemTuzlak/kiira). For CI and
> command-line use, see the [`kiira` CLI](https://github.com/AlemTuzlak/kiira).

## Requirements

The extension checks with the workspace's own TypeScript (5 or 6) when one is installed, so diagnostics match your project, and otherwise uses the TypeScript that VS Code ships for its built-in TypeScript features. It does not bundle a copy of TypeScript.

## Features

- **Live diagnostics in Markdown** — type errors in fenced code appear as you type
  (debounced) and on save, with messages mapped to the correct line and column.
- **TypeScript quick fixes inside fences** — the lightbulb (`Ctrl+.` / `Cmd+.`)
  offers TypeScript's own fixes: **auto-import a missing symbol**, fix a misspelled
  name, add a missing `await`, implement an interface, and more — with the edit
  applied back into the Markdown.
- **Kiira quick fixes** — one-click to change a mistagged ` ```ts ` fence to
  ` ```tsx ` when it contains JSX, or to tag continuation snippets with `group=…`
  so they type-check together.
- **Workspace-aware** — resolves your monorepo's packages and their types, so
  `import { x } from "@your/pkg"` checks just like it does in your editor.
- **Inspect the generated file** — *Kiira: Open Virtual File For Snippet* shows
  the synthesized `.ts`/`.tsx` a fence is checked as, including grouped snippets.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Kiira: Check Current File` | Re-check the active Markdown document. |
| `Kiira: Check Workspace` | Check every Markdown file in the workspace. |
| `Kiira: Open Virtual File For Snippet` | Inspect the generated code for a fence. |
| `Kiira: Restart Kiira Server` | Clear and re-check all open documents. |

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kiira.enable` | `true` | Enable Kiira diagnostics in Markdown files. |
| `kiira.configPath` | `kiira.config.ts` | Path to the Kiira config, relative to the workspace root. |
| `kiira.debounceMs` | `300` | Delay before re-checking after a change. |
| `kiira.checkOnChange` | `true` | Re-check as the document changes (debounced). |
| `kiira.checkOnSave` | `true` | Re-check when the document is saved. |
| `kiira.showGeneratedDiagnostics` | `false` | Show diagnostics from generated fixture code (for debugging). |

## How it works

Each code fence becomes an in-memory "virtual file" that is type-checked with your
project's compiler options and module resolution — nothing is written to disk.
Diagnostics are mapped from the virtual file back to the Markdown source. Snippets
that continue an earlier one can be tagged `group=<name>` to share scope, and
Kiira will suggest grouping when it detects a continuation.
